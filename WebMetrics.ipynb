    "The following script takes two types of files describing Species Level Networks (SLNs) as input. The first is a list of taxa and associated information like trophic guild assignment, habitat (terrestrial vs. aquatic), etc. The second file is the species-level adjacency matrix, which is a binary $\\vert U\\vert\\times \\vert U\\vert$ matrix, where $\\vert U\\vert$ is the total number of species in the network, $U$. The entries in this matrix are 0 or 1. If species $G_i$ preys on species $G_j$, then the $ij^{th}$ entry is 1, and zero otherwise.\n",

You must have Julia installed on your system to operate the code, and the Jupyter notebook environment installed for Julia. Helpful links are:\n",
